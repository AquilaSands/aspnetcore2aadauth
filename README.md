# ASP.NET Core 2.0 Azure AD authentication example

This sample application is built on the *latest* 2.0 bits to test authentication via Azure AD.

To run it, you'll need to register an application in Azure AD, and fill out the client id and authority either in
appsettings.json or user secrets. You will also need to add a client secret (in user secrets preferrably).
